          <h2>Understanding Thyroid Disorders in India</h2>
          <p>Thyroid disorders are among the most prevalent hormonal conditions in India, with estimates suggesting that 1 in 10 Indians has some form of thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is far more common than hyperthyroidism — especially in women, who are 5-8 times more likely to develop thyroid disorders than men. In Bhopal and across Madhya Pradesh, the combination of iodine-poor soil in some regions, high rates of stress, and increasing autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's thyroiditis has made thyroid issues a growing health concern.</p>
          <p>The thyroid gland — a small, butterfly-shaped gland at the base of your neck — produces hormones (T3 and T4) that regulate virtually every metabolic process in your body: heart rate, body temperature, weight, energy levels, mood, digestion, and even hair growth. When the thyroid underperforms (hypothyroidism), the entire system slows down: unexplained weight gain, persistent fatigue, hair loss, constipation, brain fog, cold intolerance, and depression are common. Diet plays a crucial role in supporting thyroid function, managing symptoms, and improving the effectiveness of thyroid medication.</p>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This guide focuses primarily on hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), the most common type. If you have hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), some recommendations differ — particularly around iodine intake. Always work with a qualified nutritionist and your doctor for a personalized plan.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>Key Nutrients Your Thyroid Needs</h2>
          <p>Before listing foods, it helps to understand what the thyroid actually needs to function. Thyroid hormone production depends on several specific micronutrients:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Iodine</strong> — The raw material for T3 and T4 production. Iodine deficiency is a leading cause of hypothyroidism globally. In India, iodized salt is the primary source.</li>
            <li><strong>Selenium</strong> — Essential for converting inactive T4 to active T3 (the form the body actually uses). Found in Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, and eggs.</li>
            <li><strong>Zinc</strong> — Supports thyroid hormone synthesis and T3 conversion. Found in pumpkin seeds, chickpeas, and whole grains.</li>
            <li><strong>Iron</strong> — Iron deficiency directly impairs thyroid hormone production. Very common in Indian women, especially those with heavy menstrual cycles.</li>
            <li><strong>Vitamin D</strong> — Deficiency is strongly associated with autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's). Most Indians are deficient, especially those who spend little time outdoors.</li>
            <li><strong>Vitamin B12</strong> — Deficiency is common in hypothyroid patients and causes fatigue, nerve issues, and worsens brain fog. Indian vegetarians are at higher risk.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Best Foods for Thyroid Health (Indian Diet)</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Iodized Salt</strong> — The simplest and most important intervention. Use iodized salt in your cooking (not rock salt / sendha namak for daily use, as it lacks iodine). This alone prevents iodine-deficiency hypothyroidism.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong> — An excellent source of selenium, iodine (in the yolk), and protein. Eggs support T4-to-T3 conversion. Include 1-2 whole eggs daily if you're non-vegetarian.</li>
            <li><strong>Moong Dal and Masoor Dal</strong> — Rich in zinc and iron, both critical for thyroid function. Dals are a cornerstone of the Indian diet and excellent for thyroid patients when combined with vitamin C sources (like lemon or tomato) to improve iron absorption.</li>
            <li><strong>Pumpkin Seeds (Kaddu ke Beej)</strong> — One of the richest plant-based sources of zinc and selenium. Add a tablespoon to salads, smoothies, or eat as a snack. Particularly valuable for vegetarians.</li>
            <li><strong>Fish (Surmai, Rohu, Katla)</strong> — Excellent source of iodine, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s reduce inflammation associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Include fish 2-3 times a week if non-vegetarian.</li>
            <li><strong>Jowar and Bajra (Millet Rotis)</strong> — Rich in zinc, iron, and fibre. Millets are nutrient-dense and low glycemic, supporting metabolic health in hypothyroid patients who tend to struggle with weight management.</li>
            <li><strong>Amla (Indian Gooseberry)</strong> — Exceptionally rich in Vitamin C, which enhances iron absorption from plant foods and provides powerful antioxidant protection against thyroid inflammation.</li>
            <li><strong>Turmeric with Black Pepper</strong> — Curcumin reduces thyroid inflammation and oxidative stress. The combination with piperine (black pepper) enhances absorption 20-fold. Add to daily cooking.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Foods to Limit or Avoid with Hypothyroidism</h2>

          <h3>1. Soy Products (Limit, Don't Eliminate)</h3>
          <p>Soy isoflavones can interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis and medication absorption when consumed in large amounts. This doesn't mean eliminating soy — occasional tofu or soy milk is fine. But daily large quantities of soy-based products can worsen hypothyroidism, especially in people with borderline low thyroid function. Keep at least a 4-hour gap between soy products and thyroid medication.</p>

          <h3>2. Cruciferous Vegetables Raw (Cook Them)</h3>
          <p>Cabbage (patta gobhi), cauliflower (phool gobhi), broccoli, and kale contain goitrogens — compounds that can reduce thyroid hormone production when eaten raw and in very large quantities. <strong>Cooking destroys most goitrogenic compounds</strong> — so cooked sabzi made with gobhi or patta gobhi is perfectly fine. Avoid raw cabbage juice or raw cruciferous vegetable smoothies in large amounts.</p>

          <h3>3. Gluten (Consider Testing)</h3>
          <p>Research shows a significant link between Hashimoto's thyroiditis (autoimmune hypothyroidism) and gluten sensitivity. If you have Hashimoto's, it's worth getting tested for celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Many patients with Hashimoto's report significant improvement in symptoms and reduced antibody levels after going gluten-free or gluten-reduced. This doesn't apply to all hypothyroid patients — only those with autoimmune thyroid disease.</p>

          <h3>4. Ultra-Processed Foods and Excess Sugar</h3>
          <p>Hypothyroidism already slows metabolism and makes weight management difficult. Ultra-processed foods — packaged snacks, fast food, sugary drinks — compound this problem by causing inflammation, blood sugar spikes, and contributing to insulin resistance. Eliminating these is one of the highest-impact dietary changes for hypothyroid patients.</p>

          <h3>5. Calcium and Iron Supplements Near Medication Time</h3>
          <p>Calcium and iron supplements significantly reduce the absorption of levothyroxine (thyroid medication). Always take thyroid medication on an empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before breakfast, and keep calcium and iron supplements at least 4 hours away from your medication dose.</p>

          <h2>The Medication-Diet Connection — What Every Thyroid Patient Must Know</h2>
          <p>One of the most commonly overlooked aspects of thyroid management is how food timing interacts with thyroid medication. Many patients in Bhopal unknowingly reduce the effectiveness of their levothyroxine by eating too soon after taking it, or by consuming certain foods and supplements that block absorption. As a clinical nutritionist, Dr. Sampada Pradeep works with every thyroid client on medication timing as part of the nutrition plan — because a perfectly designed diet that interferes with medication absorption will underperform. Key rules: take medication 30-60 minutes before eating, avoid calcium-rich foods (dairy) and iron-rich foods within 2 hours of medication, and never take calcium or iron supplements within 4 hours of your thyroid medication.</p>

            <summary style="cursor:pointer; font-weight:700;">Can diet cure hypothyroidism?</summary>
            <p style="margin-top:0.75rem; color:var(--md-muted);">Diet cannot cure hypothyroidism — if your thyroid is underactive due to Hashimoto's or structural damage, you will likely need medication. However, the right diet significantly reduces symptom severity, supports thyroid hormone production, reduces autoimmune inflammation, improves medication effectiveness, and helps manage weight gain associated with hypothyroidism. Diet is a powerful complement to medical treatment, not a replacement.</p>
          </details>

          <details style="margin-bottom:1rem; border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border-radius:8px; padding:1rem;">
            <summary style="cursor:pointer; font-weight:700;">Is it safe to eat goitrogens (gobhi, patta gobhi) with hypothyroidism?</summary>
            <p style="margin-top:0.75rem; color:var(--md-muted);">Yes, when cooked. Goitrogenic compounds in cruciferous vegetables are substantially reduced by cooking. Cooked phool gobhi, patta gobhi sabzi, and broccoli are perfectly safe for most people with hypothyroidism. What to avoid: large quantities of raw cruciferous vegetables (raw cabbage juice, raw cruciferous salads) consumed daily. Occasional raw use in small amounts is generally fine.</p>
          </details>

          <details style="margin-bottom:1rem; border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border-radius:8px; padding:1rem;">
            <summary style="cursor:pointer; font-weight:700;">What is the best time to take thyroid medication?</summary>
            <p style="margin-top:0.75rem; color:var(--md-muted);">Levothyroxine is best taken on an empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before breakfast — ideally with plain water only. Foods, especially calcium-rich (dairy) and iron-rich foods, significantly reduce absorption. Coffee also reduces absorption. Take calcium and iron supplements at least 4 hours after thyroid medication. A nutritionist can help you plan your meal timing around your medication for maximum benefit.</p>
